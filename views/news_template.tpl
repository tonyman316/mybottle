	      			A new study finds polar bears in the wild have higher metabolic rates than previously thought, and as climate change alters their environment a growing number of bears are unable to catch enough prey to meet their energy needs.

	      		<p>
	      			The study, <a>published February 2 in Science</a>, reveals the physiological mechanisms behind observed declines in polar bear populations, said first author Anthony Pagano, a Ph.D. candiate at UC Santa Cruz.

	      		<p>
		      		"We've been documenting declines in polar ear survival rates, body condition, and population numbers over the past decade," he said. "This study identifies the mechanisms that are driving those declines by looking at the actual energy needs of polar bears and how often they're able to catch seals."

	      			Pagano, who is also a wildlife biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), conducted they study as part of his Ph.D. thesis research at UC Santa Cruz, where he has been working with coauthors Terrie Williams and Daniel Costa, both professors of ecology and evolutionary biology.

      			<p class="p-margin">
      				At the end of the last ice age, a population of polar bears was stranded by the receding ice on a few islands in southeastern Alaska. Male brown bears swam acxross to the islands from the Alaskan mainland and mated with female polar bears, eventually transforming the polar bear population into brown bears.
